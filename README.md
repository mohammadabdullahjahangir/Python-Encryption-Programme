# Python-Encryption-Programme
Simple Encryption Programme

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how substitution ciphers work.
It randomly shuffles a set of characters and uses that mapping to encrypt a password or message entered by the user.
Each run produces a different cipher key, so encrypted messages cannot be decrypted unless the key is saved.
